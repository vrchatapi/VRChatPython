# VRCpy

For docs, please see out [Read The Docs](https://vrcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?)!

Re-written API wrapper for the [VRChat API](https://vrchatapi.github.io)
Please note this wrapper does NOT follow the [guidelines set by the vrchat team,](https://vrchatapi.github.io/#/?id=disclaimer)  
Specifically, this wrapper makes queries more than once per minute.  
The amount of queries per minute is a small amount above the VRChat website initially.
